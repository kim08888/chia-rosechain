Chia officially informed that it is not allowed to use the chiarose domain name, so it will be updated to the rosechain domain name later. Recently, I have been busy cracking the chia Nft Plot. Update the official website after the completion.

I apologize for the great trouble caused by the domain name issue to the chia official...

DemoPool: http://pool.rosechain.net:8080

JoinPool: https://github.com/snight1983/chia-rosechain/wiki/How-to-Join-Rose-Pool

Purpose of pooling: 

'Chia's new Plots make it impossible to obtain 100% of the revenue from the forked currency. Rose's solution can ensure that miners get 100% income, but it is not the optimal solution. I hope that other partners of forked coins can provide better solutions. '


1.3.0 ChiaRose "August 21, 21 Rose Garden Hard Fork" Announcement 
---
Release Notes:
1. This upgrade is a mandatory upgrade, in order to be fully compatible with the new Chia Plots; let Rose grow 100% of the income, avoiding only 1/8 of the income of the new Plots.
2. This upgrade provides Solo version and Pool version. Solo version can get 100% income directly. In the Pool version, you can experience the Chia Nft contract mining pool function, which can be Solo or join the pool.
3. Currently Rose provides an experimental mining pool, how to join the mining pool, please check the Wiki:
    https://github.com/snight1983/chia-rosechain/wiki/How-to-Join-Rose-Pool 

Special Note:
1. After the version is upgraded, historical blocks and planting income will not be affected.
2. After the version is upgraded, the historical version will not be able to continue to synchronize blocks and plant. This upgrade is mandatory. (Similar to ETH London hard fork)
3. The current upgrade plan adopted by Rose is not to force 7/8 of the mining pool to farmers. She still maintains Chia's distribution ratio and allows farmers to obtain full income.
    In the future, it will gradually be fully compatible with the Chia NFT contract.
4. At the official request of Chia, the ChiaRose domain name was changed to https://www.rosechain.net

Little hope:

What's next for Rose?  1. Emotional NFT Metaverse  
---
What needs to be done?
1. For your lover, bind Rose address. Rose will be used as fuel
2. Emotional metaverse creator.
3. The publisher on the chain.
4. IPFS storage tools.
5. Emotional metaverse, browser.
... ...

It will be very challenging and fun to build step by step. 

Hope she will come soon ...

What's next for Rose? 2. Blockless mining
---
Itâ€™s just a preliminary idea. Planting with heavy blocks is very costly. Is it possible that you can mine normally without blocks?

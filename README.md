Chia uses a more energy-efficient blockchain technology, which creates a consensus with less energy consumption. 
-----------------------------------------------------------

ChiaRose will use this hard-won technology (thanks to Chia), reuse Chia's consensus, let it use environmentally friendly energy consumption, and try to generate more blockchain value. Welcome friends to create the future together! 


How to grow 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Use the XCR client to directly plant the farmland made by Chia. Our vision is to maximize the reuse of energy and resources. Because Chia Tian and other resources are used, if you are worried about risks, you can use open source code to create a client. 


How to allocate 
-----------------------------------------------------------
The total output of XCR in a century is about 2.2 billion, of which 8.8% is reserved by the community for development, and the rest is obtained through planting! In the first three years, a single block rewards 200XCR, which is halved every three years. The deflation/inflation mechanism is changed. The block reward is constant at 1XCR. 



About the transaction 
-----------------------------------------------------------

Love is not a business. If you like it, plant some and give it to him (her). ChiaRose is a virtual farm that replicates Chia technology, and the preservation period of love will change with ChiaRose! This is an interesting decentralized social experiment! Its function is not for transaction. 


Miscellaneous, for Shabak 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Around 2000, a group of friends born in the 70s and 80s fell in love with a popular online game "Legend"! It left deep traces in the memories of many people.
After that, various private servers have sprung up. Help us to experience the feelings that are difficult for official uniforms. Today, all kinds of legendary private servers are still raging in the online world. For example, "Hello everyone, I am Zha Zhahui" O(∩_∩)O !!!
